This documentation is still a **Work In Progress**. Some topics have been discussed in greater depth, while others require additional clarification.

:::

**Welcome to the YETI Documentation portal.**

YETI is a L1 blockchain designed from the ground up to solve the current problems faced by existing blockchains. We have reimagined every aspect of the technology, from tokenomics to consensus, to create a fundamentally new distributed system.
This documentation is the only reliable source of the YETI architecture. We are still polishing the system's nuances, so the documentation is constantly updated and supplemented.

## Get started

If you're looking for things you can do with YETI, check out the [YETI Ecosystem](https://yetichain.com).

### Build on YETI

Get started with YETI by installing the [YETI node](https://yetichain.com), and deploying a simple DeFi app locally in Quick Start.

For in depth tutorials on the underlying aspects of the YETI Network, check out the Developer Guide and the Developer Resources.


## Why YETI?

YETI is fast, scalable, has zero transaction costs, and does no wasteful mining.

YETI chain features next-gen blockchain technology, utilizing POD (Proof of Defeating), extensible EVM and state of the art cryptography.

## Introduction to the YETI Platform
The YETI Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on technical, traffic, and ecological resources and will be gradually opened to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. The YETI Platform is an EVM compatible blockchain that solves the biggest problem in the Dapp industry. The YETI Platform will provide global developers with a series of diverse, innovative facilities and services.

## Solving market's biggest problem
Decentralized applications (Dapps) running on any blockchain contribute to the biggest use case of the blockchain industry. These Dapps are heavily sabotaged by the traditional blockchain's transaction speed. This really does not let heavy Dapps like gaming, metaverse, NFTs, etc. function to their full potential. The traditional blockchain simply can not provide the transaction speed that they need. That is the reason why these types of Dapps can decide to move away from blockchain altogether and adopt a centralised web application approach. Our blockchain solves this problem by having a high TPS capacity using the mighty POA consensus mechanism. Apart from this, our blockchain also heavily emphasizes the security of the network through the network of the validators responsible for confirming the transactions. The speed and security will create huge advantages for the Dapps, so they can carry on their innovative development in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Declaration
To empower the decentralised applications (Dapps) ecosystem

## Vision
YETI's vision is not only to be the best public blockchain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, YETI is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## Model
The endogenous token on the chain is $ABN; with the "0" fee transactions.

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as ETH, BNB and stable coins can be mapped to YETI by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on YETI.

YETI encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.

## YETI Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize usersâ€™ experience.

## Support Plan of YETI

### Financial Support
- YETI will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- YETI will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers.
- In order to reduce the cost of users on YETI Dapp, the YETI meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding $BNI in a step-wise manner.

## Traffic Support
YETI will strongly support the development of YETI ecosystem:

 - Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on YETI.
- After running successfully on YETI, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to YETI trading platform, and can be listed on it if they meet the listing standards.

## Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from YETI have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in YETI foundation roadshows for free.
- YETI will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.

## Risk Warning
All users and developers can participate in the current test environment and subsequent stages of YETI for free, and there is no charging scenario.
All users must distinguish the test environment from the Mainnet. The assets generated in the test environment have no value. Be aware of counterfeit currency fraud.
YETI announces authorization, promotion and other collaborations only through the official social media platform. Developers and users should check carefully to avoid losses.
Do not misread the official website (yetichain.com), and be cautious with private key phishing.
