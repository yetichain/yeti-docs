Various **Layer 2 solutions** aimed at improving the **scalability of the Ethereum** network, **primarily transaction throughput**, have been developed over the past years. The ultimate and intended benefit for Ethereum network users is a reduction in gas fees, while maintaining decentralisation and security.

**Antofy Blockchain is a Layer 2 Rollup solution** that combines data availability and **execution verification in Layer 1 of the Ethereum** blockchain to ensure L2 state transition security and reliability.

This section will describe the infrastructure that Antofy designed and implemented for its EVM, with a focus on providing an overview of the components used in the development of the **EVM Protocol**.
