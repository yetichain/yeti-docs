### What is the difference between EVM Compatibility and EVM Equivalence?

The ultimate goal is not **compatibility**. The ultimate goal is **equivalence**. **Solutions that are compatible enable most existing apps to work, but sometimes with code changes**. Additionally, compatibility may lead to the breaking of developer toolings.

**YETI Blockchain strives for EVM Equivalence because it means that most applications, tools, and infrastructure built on Ethereum can immediately port over to YETI Blockchain with limited to no changes needed**. Things are designed to work 100% on day one. This is critical because:

1. **Development teams don't have to make changes to their code**, which could introduce a security vulnerability.
2. **No code changes are needed**. You don't need additional audits, which saves time and money. 
3. **blockchain ultimately benefits from the security and decentralization of Ethereum**, since transactions are still finalizing on Ethereum.
4. Allows YETI Blockchain to **benefit from the already vibrant and active Ethereum community**.
5. Allows for **significant and quick dApp adoption**, since apps built on Ethereum today are designed to be compatible.
