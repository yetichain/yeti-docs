### Don't you have tokens of the future blockchain for sale?

YES. YETI is not a PoS blockchain that could be decentralized only through token distribution. All $YET tokens (BEP20/ERC20) will be distributed by Fairlaunch and $YET (native chain) among validators when the blockchain is up and running.

### How exactly will you raise funds?

We need the YETI blockchain decentralized as much as possible from the very beginning. To achieve that, we have Fairlaunched the $YET (BEP20/ERC20) tokens.&#x20;

### How much money do you need to build YETI?

We are aiming for $1 000 000 to develop a blockchain.
